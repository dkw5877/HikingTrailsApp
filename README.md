HikingTrails

This application is used to show various local hiking trails overlayed on a standard map view. 
The hiking trail data comes from  Ventrua Country Trails website (http://www.venturacountytrails.org)
which has GPS tracks that can be downloaded for a variety of trails in the Ventura County area. This XML
data is parsed into a custom trail object and an MKPolyline overlay is created and displayed on the map.
